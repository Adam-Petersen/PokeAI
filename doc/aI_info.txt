	CATCH
		- Pokemon must be wild encounter
		- Pokemon has not been caught yet
	LEVEL
		- Wild Encounter
		- Party doesn't meet level requirements'
		- All pokemon same level except starter who is 5 levels higher
	WAAC
		- Trainer battle
		- All other battles


Mode Battle routines:

WAAC:
- If one or more attacks will bring enemy health to 0, use one with highest accuracy
- If other party mon can do over twice as much damage, switch
	- Keep in mind max damage possible
- If enemy can kill you in the next attack, switch to who can do most damage
- If highest damage attakc does more than half enemy hp, choose attack that maximises score
	- score formula: (damage * 100 / max_hp)  - (1 - acc%)*100
- If highest damage attack does less than half enemy hp, choose attack that maximizes score
	- score formula:  (damage * 100 / max_hp) + 20*(POI/BRN/PAR %) + 30*(SLP/FRZ %) - (1 - acc%)*100

CATCH
- If catch probability is 100% for two or more balls, use cheapest ball
- If catch probability is over 75% for any ball, use ball with highest % chance
- If C is <= 30:
	- Determine most important pokemon A, i.e the one that can inflict the best status going by FRZ -> SLP -> PAR -> ANY
	- If A is < 50% hp, heal 
	- If pokemon has no status and A is not out, switch to A
	- If pokemon has no status and A is out, use status move
	- If status is inflicted, use ball with highest chance of success
- If 30 < C <= 150
	- Determine most important pokemon A, i.e the one that can inflict a status with highest % chance without killing pokemon
	- If target has no status and A is not out, switch to A
	- If target has no status and A is out, use status attack
	- If target has status or there are no status attacks that can be used, use attack with highest damage that can't kill
	- If any health is below 1/3 or no more moves to use without killing, use ball with best % chance of catching
- C > 150
	- If health below 1/3 or no moves can be used, use ball with best % chance
	- If current pokemon can't use attack but other can, switch
	- Use attack with highest damage that can't kill
	
LEVEL
	- If player pokemon can die by enemy move, switch to pokemon based on order:
		- Other pokemon that needs training and can't be killed by best attack
		- Pokemon with highest damage attack
	- Use attack with highest damage
